# PathSearch
Java application to search for the shortest path between two intersection points in a map. All of the front end code was provided 
by the UCSD MOOC team. I only implemented the backend data structres and algorithms for the following:
```
1. Breadth First Search
2. Dijkstra Algorithm
3. A Star Search
```

Run the following file after opening the project in Eclipse:
```
src/application/MapApp.java
```
